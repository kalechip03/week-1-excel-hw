# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
### Purpose: Louise wants to know the best way to set up a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for her play, Fever.

The data we looked at included dates, country of projects, goal amounts, types of projects being fundraised, pledged goal amounts, average goal amounts, and most importantly the factors that led to successful Kickstarter campaigns. We utilized the COUNTIFS function in Excel worksheets, as well as used pivot charts and tables to visualize our findings.

## Analysis & Challenges

In our analysis we looked specifically at what time of year Kickstarter campaigns for play fundraising was most successful, as well as how much the average goal and pledge amount ranges they had.

The main challenges we ran into when running our calculations were errors when selecting the incorrect data columns, not including the correct ranges when using the COUNTIFS function to determine the number of successful, failed, and canceled projects, and when creating the pivot table & chart for the "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" graph, entering the data into the incorrect fields leading to the axes containing the incorrect data inputs. All issues were resolved for functional functions and graphs that properly visualize our data.

## Results

When reviewing theatre outcomes by launch date, we found that the best time to start a Kickstarter campaign was during spring. The number of successful campaigns was highest in the month of May. Winter was the least successful time to launch a Kickstarter campaign. The month with the lowest number of successful campaigns was December. One thing I noticed was that the month of October had no project cancellations, but there was a spike upwards of both successful and failed projects before the number of projects declined again until February.

When looking at outcomes based on the goal amounts, we found that the most successful plays (70-80% success rate) had goal amounts of <$1,000-$4,999, the second most successful plays (60-70% success rate) having goal amounts between $35,000-$44,999. The lowest success rate was the goal amounts of $45,000-$49,999.

Other data I would like to look into is the average number of donors per project, and while we were able to filter the projects by country, it would be interesting to be able to filter by states in the US to see which states the successful, failed, and canceled projects arose from, as well as which states had the most donors. Would a play be more successful if its campaign was based in New York state? What about a musical that was trying to launch in Texas? Which states were most interested in funding these projects?
