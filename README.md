###Purpose: In this analysis, we looked at data surrounding successful, failed, and canceled Kickstarter campaign projects for putting together plays.

The data we looked at included dates, goal amounts, types of projects being fundraised, pledged goal amounts, average goal amounts, and most importantly whether or not the projects were successful.

##Analysis & Challenges

In our analysis we looked specifically at what time of year Kickstarter campaigns for play fundraising was most successful, as well as how much the average goal and pledge amount ranges they had.

Winter was the least successful time to launch a Kickstarter campaign. The month with the lowest number of successful campaigns was December.

When looking at outcomes based on the goal amounts, we found that the most successful plays had goal amounts of $45,000+, the second most successful plays having goal amount between $25,000-$30,000.
